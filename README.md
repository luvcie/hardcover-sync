# Hardcover Sync Browser Extension

This extension provides a seamless cross-device reading experience, synchronizing your reading progress exactly where you left off on your previous device. From computer, to tablet.

For example, if you're reading a book on a Kobo ereader with [this plugin](https://github.com/billiam/hardcoverapp.koplugin) and later switch to an in-browser PDF reader on your computer, your progress will be automatically fetched. You can then continue updating your current page, allowing for a connected experience between devices, then, when you come back to your Kobo, your pdf progress will be there.. 

Designed for minimal distraction, it offers essential tools to keep your progress synchronized with [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/).

## Features

- **PDF Progress Tracking:** Manually update your current page on [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/) and automatically fetch where you left off in another device.
- **Book Search:** Search for books using Hardcover's built-in search engine.
- **Filename Auto-detection:** Automatically identifies book titles from pdf filenames to simplify the search.
- **Compact Floating Window:** A non-intrusive, customizable interface to manage your progress while reading. This allows to use it outside of the web browser too, in case the user wants to use a different PDF reader.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Efficiently update pages and manage the floating window with available keybinds.
- **Library Management:** Easily add and remove books from your Hardcover library directly from the extension.
- **Theme Customization:** Personalize the extension with a selection of dark, light, and classic themes to fit your ~~rice~~ working environment. :)
